2. **Emotiv Reliability**: Hardware/software issues with headset
   - **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly, have backup hardware

### Medium Risk
1. **Robot Safety**: Physical harm if safety fails
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, hardware emergency stop
   
2. **Latency**: May exceed 250ms in some configurations
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize inference, use GPU, reduce window size

### Low Risk
1. **Kafka Reliability**: Message loss or delays
   - **Mitigation**: Proper configuration, monitoring
   
2. **Documentation**: Incomplete or outdated
   - **Mitigation**: Already comprehensive, keep updated
