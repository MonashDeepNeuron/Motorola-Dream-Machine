## 🎯 What This System ACTUALLY Does (Verified Working)

The Motorola Dream Machine creates a brain-computer interface that:
1. **✅ Captures** EEG brain signals from Emotiv headsets OR simulates them realistically
2. **✅ Processes** signals in real-time with filtering and feature extraction  
3. **✅ Predicts** user intentions using machine learning (mock/real modes)
4. **✅ Controls** robot movements with 7 distinct commands
5. **✅ Streams** all data continuously to JSONL files for analysis

  window_size: 1024       # 4 seconds at 256 Hz  
  overlap: 0.5           # 50% overlap
  channels: 14           # Number of channels

# Robot Control Settings

# Watch live updates to your existing file
tail -f ursim_test_v1/asynchronous_deltas.jsonl

# Example output:
{"dx": 0.0, "dy": 0.05, "dz": 0.0}
{"dx": 0.05, "dy": 0.0, "dz": 0.0}
{"dx": 0.0, "dy": 0.0, "dz": 0.05}
```

### Enhanced Format (New)
```bash
# Watch detailed command log
tail -f output/robot_commands.jsonl

# Example output:
{"timestamp": "2025-07-20T19:37:23.960", "command": "move_y_positive", "confidence": 0.85, "dx": 0.0, "dy": 0.05, "dz": 0.0}
```

### Data Analysis (WORKING)
```bash
# Analyze your JSONL data
python3 tools/analyze_commands.py --input ursim_test_v1/asynchronous_deltas.jsonl
# ✅ Creates movement plots, statistics, heatmaps
```

# Train with synthetic data (works immediately)
python3 training/train_model.py --epochs 10

# Quick training for testing
python3 training/train_model.py --quick --epochs 5

# Results saved to:
# - models/best_model.pth (trained model)
# - models/training_history.json (metrics)
# - models/training_progress.png (plots)
```
